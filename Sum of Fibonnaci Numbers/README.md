# Explanation:
# What is Fibonnaci Numbers Sequence?
=>  
(0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,....)
# How this Set Consitute?
=>
here a = 0 and b = 1 and sum = a + b = 1;
now we move one integar ahead and a = b that is 1 or b = sum that is 1 also 
sum a + b = 1 + 1 = 2;
then move one integar ahead again and a = b that is 1 or b = sum that is 2
sum = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3;
same process goes on....!
sum = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5;
sum = a + b = 3 + 5 = 8;
sum = a + b = 5 + 8 = 13;
=>
Frist Two Values of Set is always 0 and 1.
=>
We iniliaze frist two variables with 0 and 1.
let a = 0;
let b = 1;
=> As we know sum of fibonnaci series is sum of two previous numbers;
let sum = a + b;
sum = 0 + 1;
sum = 1;
# How we get 2 and onwards sum result then?
=>
We intialize a = b;
and sum = b;
a = b;
a = 1 that is 1 now ( Second Number of Fibonnaci Numbers Set )
sum = b; 
sum = 1; ( Value that we get from previous Calculations )
sum = 1 + 1 = 2;
=>
Now we intialize;
a = b;
that is 1 now;
sum = b;
that is 2 now;
sum = 1 + 2 = 3;
And this swapping process goes on to make a series of Fibonnaci Sum.
